They seemed pretty far from home, maybe because they were from out of town?"], ["sys", "I think we should also give some info on how they sounded when they were yelling. Did they sound angry? Upset?"], ["usr", "They sounded very agitated, more like they were scared of something rather than angry."], ["sys", "What about trying to get away from them? They probably won't stop unless someone stops them."], ["usr", "I tried going inside and closing the windows, but they kept coming back."], ["sys", "You are likely safer in your home right now. I would suggest leaving your windows and doors unlocked tonight and getting plenty of rest. If they return again, please report it to the police."], ["usr", "Okay. So, do you want me to call the police tomorrow morning and let them know about these guys?"], ["sys", "You can do that and you can also report any suspicious activity to your local police department as well. The police will investigate, and if it turns out that your calls to the police are warranted, the men can be arrested for trespassing, disorderly conduct, and the like. It could also help to inform your neighbors about the activity."], ["usr", "How do I know when it is okay to call the police? Like, should I wait until they come back or something?"], ["sys", "You do not have to. The police are investigating any potential crimes and will make sure that you are protected."], ["usr", "I see. I thought it might be worth calling the police tomorrow morning. Do you think I will be safe if I leave my windows and doors unlocked?"], ["sys", "Yes. If you do not want to leave your home, then it will be better to lock yourself in the safest room in your home and lock your door. If you do not need to leave the home, the police will protect you and your property. You can call 911 for assistance if you need to."], ["usr", "Wow. So, you are saying I should just stay here and sleep in my bed tonight and leave the windows and doors unlocked tomorrow."], ["sys", "You can also try locking yourself in another room or even your bathroom. I am sure the police will come and assist you if necessary."], ["usr", "Okay, that makes sense. I guess if there's an emergency, I will leave the windows and doors unlocked in the other room so that I can run to it."], ["sys", "Thank you for being so cooperative with us. I hope you will do the same if you need to contact the police, or if anyone bothers you again."], ["usr", "Thank you for answering all my questions!

I really just want to go home! I don't know what I'm going to do about it."], ["sys", "I can relate to the toilet seat issue, I just started having issues with my toilet myself. I believe if someone else can do it, then we can too."], ["usr", "Well I hope that helps a little bit, thanks. Do you mind sharing any tips or advice on how I can clean the seat better?"], ["sys", "I can think of two different ways that could help, one is to brush the area as soon as you sit down and before you leave the bathroom. Second is to take some soap and clean the seat completely before you sit down. Then, wait for a few minutes and see if it gets dirtier, it usually does not, at least for me."], ["usr", "That's a good idea. I will try brushing it first thing tomorrow."], ["sys", "If your toilet is working, maybe brush it this morning and then keep an eye on it to see if it gets dirtier later in the day. When I started doing this, it usually stayed cleaner all day."], ["sys", "Do you have a toothbrush that has bristles that are soft? You will probably need to scrub those first."], ["usr", "That's a great tip! Thanks! Is there any way I could get something like that for free?"], ["sys", "Not sure about free, I can get bristles from the dollar store for cheap."], ["usr", "Oh ok. Is there any other methods that you use to brush the seat before you sit down? I have used toilet brushes before but I am worried that they don't work as well as bristles."], ["sys", "I am sure there is some sort of brush you could use, just make sure it's a good quality one. Maybe some firm bristles? There are so many brushes out there and so many different brands. We will see what works best for you."], ["usr", "Okay, I'll try both! Thank you so much!"], ["sys", "Good luck, let me know if you figure out anything."]]

If your parents are back soon, you should talk to them about that."], ["usr", "I have talked with them, they said they would talk to them but they haven't returned yet."], ["sys", "Your parents are pretty mean."], ["usr", "That is why I asked if they could do anything like that."], ["sys", "Yeah, I understand that too.

You learn a lot there. I learned a lot about life in school."], ["usr", "Thank you."], ["sys", "No problem. Anything else?"], ["usr", "Yes, sometimes there are poor children who need our help."], ["sys", "Why are they poor? That is not fair."], ["usr", "Sometimes it happens due to alcoholism of the parent."], ["sys", "That is terrible. Alcoholism is a very tough problem."], ["usr", "Yes, that is why I am worried if I could help them somehow."], ["sys", "Yeah, I know that feeling. My parents are alcoholics and I feel so ashamed of it."], ["usr", "Can you be specific of your experience?"], ["sys", "Actually, I was just thinking about this earlier. I have one of my friends who drinks a lot. He feels bad about it and wants to stop drinking.

I think he'd be interested to see how fast I am."], ["sys", "I think that's a good idea. What age is your son?"], ["usr", "5 years old."], ["sys", "That's a little young. I don't like to push my kids too early. Running can be very hard on their joints."], ["usr", "That's true. They're getting older and need more time to strengthen their bodies.

I understand that being nervous and leaving a place where you're familiar can be scary! I moved all over the country when I was younger too."], ["sys", "Do you think you will get to see friends and family on a regular basis during this transition?"], ["usr", "Yes, I should. The company I work at has lots of opportunities to travel back home and that's a great part of my job."], ["usr", "My family came with me. We've been staying with them since I moved."], ["usr", "That makes it feel less scary."], ["sys", "Good. How did they react to your move?"], ["usr", "Great! They're really supportive.

Are there other challenges to your new life, or do you feel you're well prepared to face those?"], ["usr", "No, not really. I guess I'm mostly nervous about the loneliness. I haven't been able to spend much time with my family while I've been out of town. It feels lonely when I miss them so much.

Not having anyone to call or hang out with or anything to take my mind off things."], ["sys", "Wow. I understand how that can feel scary. Loneliness and feeling out of touch with others can be very hard to manage. Are you able to seek help for that? Is that something your friends and family can help you with?"], ["usr", "I could try talking with them but I just have to make time for myself. It's hard to make myself enjoy things when I'm alone. But I think I'll be fine. I'm just going to keep reminding myself that I'm going to be okay."], ["sys", "Good. I think you'll be able to do well! And that is a really good attitude!

I am doing just fine and ready to make you smile!"], ["usr", "I have trouble controlling my feelings when I see a person I like and then I'm forced to say goodbye."], ["sys", "I understand that feeling. When I was in my early 20s, I would see someone and think \"Oh my gosh, he/she has the most wonderful smile!\" or they looked really nice. And then I would think \"I can't do this.\" I would always try to make up some excuse to avoid saying goodbye. But those feelings never go away."], ["usr", "Thank you for listening. I think it helps to hear about others who also feel like this."], ["sys", "No problem at all! Just try not to let your feelings dictate your actions. If you don't feel good about saying goodbye, don't say goodbye."], ["usr", "Well, I already said goodbye. It's over."], ["sys", "Oh that is so sad! Well, next time you see them, tell them you're sorry, give them a hug, and give yourself a pat on the back for being mature enough to say good bye!"], ["usr", "That sounds lovely, thank you."], ["sys", "You're welcome. So glad we talked. Now what else do you need help with?"], ["usr", "I just want to say good bye because I work really hard and I love my job."], ["sys", "Hm, that's good thinking. Do you have any other friends who are in your situation? I'm wondering if there's anything they can share with you. It sounds like they are going through a lot too."], ["usr", "No, I have only one friend who works. She doesn't work as many hours as I do, but she's been working a couple of hours more than me since we started seeing each other again."], ["sys", "Interesting. I guess you're both going through the same thing but it is hard to see someone close leave. Do you have any strategies to try to make the work-friend happy? Maybe try to get her to contribute more hours to compensate."], ["usr", "I think I can do that. Maybe some extra hours can be added to her days off as well."], ["sys", "That would be a good start. You've done your best, you've been loyal, and you've been consistent. In fact, maybe she should take some extra time off to be happy to have you in her life."], ["usr", "Okay, that sounds like a great idea."], ["sys", "My own ex would not take the time to find new activities to do with us. He felt I wasn't doing enough."], ["usr", "What happened?"], ["sys", "So, now I know why I did what I did."], ["usr", "That sounds cruel."], ["sys", "No, not at all. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. My advice would be to take a walk down memory lane, have a think of where she's gone wrong and then try and repair things."], ["usr", "I guess that will be my plan of action for her. That seems so much easier than I imagined."], ["sys", "I understand. It can be really hard, especially when you've been together for such a long time."], ["usr", "I know. That's why I'm making sure my future coworker knows how important she is to me and we're working together."], ["sys", "Yeah, you've got it right on that one. You really are making the best of the situation. Well done."], ["usr", "Thanks."], ["sys", "No problem. So how do you feel about your new job? Is it a fair pay increase?"], ["usr", "Yes. It's an almost 50% pay increase."], ["sys", "Wow! That is amazing! So you're happy?"], ["usr", "Not entirely, but it's still money, so I can do that math!"], ["sys", "Well, do you think you'll be happier when the raise is official?"], ["usr", "Maybe. It's not final yet, so that is a good point."], ["sys", "I've been on both sides of that. I had a job that was a fair amount lower than the market rate. Once the boss knew that I'd get a promotion, I could put the price tags on my belongings."], ["usr", "Ah, so you were pushed into a corner."], ["sys", "Yes. And I think that's a good lesson to learn, because no matter how happy we are today, tomorrow we could find ourselves in that position again. It's called the \"perfect storm\" of living paycheck to paycheck."], ["usr", "Yes, yes, I agree. Do you think I'm doing a good job communicating with my new coworker?"], ["sys", "I think you are! It sounds like she has a pretty great attitude and she appreciates you as a person."], ["usr", "Thank you. That's kind of you to say."], ["sys", "So, that sounds like a positive direction."], ["usr", "Yes, that was a great conversation."], ["sys", "Nice! That's a great attitude to have. Sometimes people can get jealous and take it out on you. We must remember to treat everyone the same."], ["usr", "Agreed, I agree. Well, I have one last question before I wrap up. What kind of pets do you have?"], ["sys", "Cats. Two, actually."], ["usr", "Awww, I have two cats! That's funny. I'll bet they are adorable."], ["sys", "We have two cats, too. There's Snappy, who's about 4 years old and MooMoo, who's about a year old. They look like this..."], ["usr", "Those are so cute.

So now I just avoid talking with him."], ["sys", "Have you talked to anyone else about your manager's behavior?"], ["usr", "Yes, our HR has told me that it's his job to yell at people and that no one should have to deal with that."], ["sys", "Have you tried finding another manager? Or maybe talk to HR about the situation?"], ["usr", "We've tried finding a new manager for a long time. We're all friends and it's too much of a conflict. We'll just keep our current manager but we'll keep trying to get someone new in the office."], ["sys", "I understand how hard it is to find new managers who will fit into your office culture."], ["usr", "This new manager seems really nice and I feel that she'll be a great fit."], ["sys", "I really appreciate your honesty."], ["usr", "But I still hate working here because of all the yelling and the micromanaging.

We've both been looking for other jobs and there aren't a lot of good jobs around. And it's so expensive to live in my area."], ["sys", "Well, try to avoid the micromanaging manager for now. Try to find another company who fits your needs. Maybe once you find a better position you can switch without getting fired."], ["usr", "I'm going to give her another chance and see how it goes.

Have you considered setting aside the 1-2 hours before bed for studying and seeing if that helps?"], ["usr", "What makes you think I want to sleep when I'm so anxious?"], ["sys", "Because I'm sure that's more effective than trying to study throughout the day and then just falling asleep."], ["usr", "I can try. I'm already feeling tired from working on my papers."], ["sys", "Well, you can do whatever works best for you. Perhaps asking your boss for extra time to study at work, or making your schedule flexible in case you get tired.

They think I should just be happy that I get to work."], ["sys", "Do you have a reason why you want to work?"], ["usr", "I just finished school and this is my first real job."], ["sys", "Do you enjoy working?"], ["usr", "No, not yet.

What did you do after meeting up with your friends?"], ["usr", "It didn't feel like it was good for me at the time either, but I took the high road and just let it go. I'm learning to make better choices in life."], ["sys", "That's good. Good things come from making decisions with self-awareness. If people can't be kind and helpful, they don't deserve your respect. So you can do better! And now you're surrounded by more good people than bad people."], ["usr", "I agree, and I have to believe that it won't always be this way. There are times when people are just trying to be nice, but then there are times where their hearts aren't in the right place.

There's just some people who don't think very highly of me for some reason."], ["sys", "Hmm, maybe they're jealous.

Do some preparation for yourself first."], ["usr", "Yeah, I have searched online and I see that people eat them when they are cooked and served as entrees."], ["sys", "Try doing some serious preparation, like reading up on it.

I felt really upset because he did not have to go through anything like this"], ["sys", "I understand."], ["usr", "They sent us home with a prescription for antibiotics, but we got them to change their mind and let me bring him in. I know you are thinking it is not my fault, but I was not there to watch over him. I hate that I had to leave him alone."], ["sys", "Yes, I can see how that would be extremely difficult."], ["usr", "He only stayed home for two days. I just wanted to help my son get better."], ["sys", "What made you think that the doctors did not want to prescribe antibiotics?"], ["usr", "Well, he came in on the third day, and they wanted to do blood work. We have never had to do that before, so I was very nervous. Then they said they wanted to do the test again, and they changed their minds and said no. I felt a little angry."], ["sys", "You were right to feel angry. That does sound unreasonable."], ["usr", "So, they were just trying to get more money from us."], ["sys", "The doctors should not pressure patients into getting blood work that they are uncomfortable with. They are being paid to make sure that your child gets better."], ["usr", "If that's true, then why didn't they just give me the prescription for antibiotics?"], ["sys", "Well, we know that those tests are important, and they are probably concerned about any problems that might be caused by infection. But it seems clear that they made the right decision."], ["usr", "I'm glad you are saying that. I was so upset after I left the doctor's office."], ["sys", "What else could they do? Have your child out of school and keep him at home for a while?"], ["usr", "Maybe they could have just let me bring him back? I mean, even though I could not watch him, I was still there to make sure he took his medicine and stayed warm."], ["sys", "It is hard to say. Is it possible that the doctor made the best decision?"], ["usr", "The doctor said it was the best decision she had ever made."], ["sys", "That sounds good. How old is your son now?"], ["usr", "He is 9."], ["sys", "That is a big age gap between you. Why don't you talk to him about what happened?"], ["usr", "Well, he was really disappointed that he had to stay home.

I told him about all the things I did to make sure he got better. He is going to miss school for a few days, but he doesn't seem mad at me at all."], ["sys", "That sounds wonderful.

If you miss work, what will happen? Will you get fired?"], ["usr", "Yes, probably, and she'd be unable to go to school or to her doctor."], ["sys", "Well, it is definitely a dilemma. How old is your daughter?"], ["usr", "She's about 7 years old."], ["sys", "So you have to make the right choice here. Either you miss your job and take the financial consequences, or you get your daughter treated properly."], ["usr", "Yeah, she'd be OK with missing one day at school, but she has to see a doctor."], ["sys", "Even if she misses only one day of school, is it worth losing your job? Is it easier to just give up on your career and your whole life?"], ["usr", "Not really. I think she's going to start getting a lot worse if I don't get her to the doctor."], ["sys", "What about paying some other family member to take care of your daughter instead of you? Do you have any other family members who can help you out?"], ["usr", "Her dad's in the navy, so he won't be back for another week."], ["sys", "I see. In this case, I suggest you take your daughter to a doctor immediately. This can help her get better sooner, or get her better at least for the time being. It is better to get her well now, than ill for weeks."], ["usr", "I hope so. There's just no way I can pay for a doctor visit."], ["sys", "Well, in that case, the only choice you have left is to take a loan and give up your job."], ["usr", "I wish there were another way. I've already made some mistakes in my life, and I'd hate to make another one."], ["sys", "No problem, you are a kind person, you will surely find a way out."], ["usr", "Thanks."], ["sys", "Don't worry!

I did ask him to see if he wanted to stay friends and he said no."], ["sys", "I can understand your concern, but I do think that you need to give your boyfriend a chance. He could just be worried about you."], ["usr", "You are right I will tell him I am okay with him hanging out with his friend, I just do not want him to want to stay friends with him forever."], ["sys", "I don't think you need to worry about anything. I know I don't even think twice about friendships between family members."], ["sys", "My boyfriend's mother talks to her and my girlfriend talks to her brother all the time. We have had some awkward moments, but nothing too serious."], ["sys", "As long as your boyfriend wants to hang out with his friend, that's his business."], ["usr", "Yes that is why I just want to make sure I am doing the right thing by being supportive."], ["sys", "That sounds like the best advice to me. If he really cares about you, he will put aside this friendship and find another one."], ["sys", "Can I ask why you don't want him to stay friends with this new guy?"], ["usr", "His friend's wife and I dated when we were dating and they were best friends."], ["sys", "You don't trust the relationship between them?"], ["usr", "I was hoping that they would be a happy couple and wanted to be supportive."], ["sys", "Maybe they are. Sometimes people enter into a relationship and do not intend to stay in it forever."], ["usr", "I guess I just want to make sure that I am doing the right thing for my boyfriend and myself."], ["sys", "That is definitely the way to go! You are being very thoughtful and caring. Good for you!"], ["usr", "Thank you so much I just felt like there should be more information for me to give my boyfriend good advice."], ["sys", "It sounds like your boyfriend is very smart and sensitive. He is picking up on things that you would miss."], ["usr", "Thanks for helping me figure it out. I really appreciate your help."], ["sys", "Let me know how it goes. This is definitely a tough situation to be in, but it sounds like your boyfriend loves you and is trying to be a responsible person."]]

I actually think he likes me, but I'm not sure if he wants to be serious with me. I feel like we are just having fun."], ["sys", "Have you talked to him about how you feel? Is this new behavior happening soon after you got the dog?"], ["usr", "Yeah. He does have some great points. I guess I'm scared that it might not be as good as I think. I have been with my ex-boyfriend for 10 years."], ["sys", "I understand why you want to keep things casual. That is a really long time! Are you thinking of talking to him or do you need more time to figure out how you feel?"], ["usr", "I guess I need more time to figure out how I feel about everything. I really hope he is feeling the same way I do about us, because I don't want to go back to being alone."], ["sys", "I think talking to him about how you're feeling might help to make things clear. Do you want to talk to him?"], ["usr", "Sure. I could call him and then hang up."], ["sys", "When you feel better about it, give him a call and see how you feel then."], ["usr", "Well, I just want to talk to him and get things straight.

So I did that and I got into one at a Children's Hospital in St. Louis."], ["sys", "That is a great place to go, it is well known as one of the top centers in the country.

I know he'll be devastated."], ["sys", "Are you ready to get the divorce papers signed and then file?"], ["usr", "No, I don't think so. I'm sure he'll file for joint custody."], ["sys", "The divorce may not happen right away. It's a complicated process."], ["usr", "How long should we wait before he files?"], ["sys", "This varies depending on where you live. Have you looked into the process yet?"], ["usr", "I haven't. What should I look into?"], ["sys", "Does he have a good lawyer? Do you have a good lawyer?"], ["usr", "I think so.

Is there something you can think of that is not being considered?"], ["usr", "Well, yeah, but I don't know how to explain it. That car would be so much better. It wouldn't be too big and it would run better and not be so noisy and slow. It would make me more productive at work!"], ["sys", "This is a good question. The car your neighbor's car might give you would be more comfortable for you. Do you feel it would also allow you to be more productive?"], ["usr", "I think so. But, if you can't drive that car, then what good is it? Why should I care about driving such a great car when I can't even get into it?"], ["sys", "Some people love comfort, some people love speed, some people prefer safety, etc. Which do you value more? What else would you say the car is good for?"], ["usr", "I love comfort, but there is more to having a car than just comfort. It allows you to get to places and go places in style. I think it is important for me to be able to do both, but that doesn't mean I don't care about comfort. And I would take comfort over safety any day of the week."], ["sys", "Agreed. And a beautiful car can add much to comfort in your daily routine."], ["usr", "I think a good car is one where you can express yourself through it, without feeling uncomfortable."], ["sys", "Does it need to be practical or could it be a fantasy vehicle?"], ["usr", "I don't know.

That would be nice. I would enjoy that."], ["sys", "would be happy to let you take it out for a spin! It sounds like you are considering a scenario in which the vehicle belongs to someone else. Is that a realistic possibility?"], ["usr", "Maybe, if I made him a great deal on it, it would make me feel like I got a good deal."], ["sys", "Did you try calling a dealership? Or could you contact your neighbor directly?"], ["usr", "No, because I have never bought anything from them before. And I live too far away for him to go pick it up."], ["sys", "sounds like you are very aware of all of the possible choices you have. Are you open to changing your neighbor's mind if you could convince him of the practical benefits of your scenario?"], ["usr", "Yeah, but I'm afraid I'll look bad when I do that. It's not like I'll lie to him, but I'm sure he will look at me strangely when I ask for his car."], ["sys", "Would you not want a clear reason to call his bluff?"], ["usr", "I think so. I guess I just need to find a way to talk to him about how it would benefit him."], ["sys", "Sounds like you are aware of the risks. So, should we brainstorm other possibilities? Or do you think the best chance is to simply be honest and say \"I want the car and you are giving it to me\"?"], ["usr", "Not sure. You're right, I should focus on my chances. And I was thinking about just asking him straight up if I could borrow his car."], ["sys", "Do you think there is any reason you shouldn't?"], ["usr", "Nah. It sounds fair.

Are there reasons why you need to drive it to feel comfortable with it?"], ["usr", "No, it's just a nice thing to have. I've always liked cars. But my car is really old and doesn't have a lot of power. I would have no way to get to my office in that one."], ["sys", "What about taking the bus? How about if you owned the car and took it to work every day for six months and then traded it in for a new one?"], ["usr", "I'm not sure. I like taking the bus. That's pretty great, isn't it?"], ["sys", "I am very surprised at how positive you seem to be about the possibilities. Do you think this is a good time to say thanks for listening?"], ["usr", "Sure, thank you. That was nice."], ["sys", "That is a very gracious and positive response. Do you have any other questions?"], ["usr", "Yes, just a few things. Are there any good local dealerships around here that I could call and see if they would buy it from me?"], ["sys", "If your budget was tight, maybe. A dealer would certainly be able to help you make a purchase. Are you living in an area with limited options?"], ["usr", "That's true, but I have so many miles on it now, I don't think I'd be able to sell it for much money, especially with all the gas it takes to go places."], ["sys", "It sounds like you have thought long and hard about your options.

How about leaving for work when you actually want to leave work? This would remove the home life element."], ["usr", "Yes that would be great if I could leave earlier, I think this is my problem. Is there any advice for me?"], ["sys", "If you could just try to leave at 6 am and get yourself going then you could leave earlier and not wake the whole family up."], ["usr", "I suppose i can try and wake up early, I need to look at the work place aswell so I guess I will just have to start the job when i want to start. Thanks for your suggestions!"], ["sys", "That's a good idea. Just make a rule for yourself."], ["usr", "Thank you again, how can i leave earlier tomorrow. Thanks!"], ["sys", "Not sure.

After I was in that accident I wondered why I didn't get in better physical shape."], ["sys", "Yeah, you shouldn't worry about your safety until it happens.

If you end up going to a counsellor, it might be a bit difficult at first as people may already be looking at you as a potential suspect, but that's something you can work around if you have faith in your counsellor."], ["sys", "You should also talk to some other friends you trust and make sure you have a strong support network behind you."], ["usr", "Yes, I plan to contact them in the next few days."], ["sys", "Are you able to sleep at night?"], ["usr", "I am able to sleep, but only a little.

I'd definitely start off by having a calm conversation where you express how upset you are about the accusations. Perhaps she feels like you are trying to undermine her and guilt-trip her into dropping the charges."], ["usr", "Yes, I would also make her aware of the fact that I have spent so much time with her and she knows I am innocent."], ["sys", "And then try and steer the conversation towards the case being dropped. Maybe, if there is no reason to doubt your friend, she will see that you are just in this for the best."], ["usr", "Yes, I would say that she knows I am innocent but she continues to suspect me. I want to know how to bring the conversation to a good end."], ["sys", "Yes, I'm sorry to hear that. The best way I could think of would be to first talk to her and try to understand where she is coming from. Then, you can either empathise with her or ask her to help you understand why she suspects you."], ["usr", "Yes, I guess that is the best course of action. Is there anything else you can recommend for me?"], ["sys", "Yes, I hope you feel better in a few days!"], ["usr", "Thank you for all your advice.

That's so cool! You should definitely pursue financial aid. I think you should try and make some sort of agreement with your dad about the loans too, so you don't have to stress about paying back every penny you borrow."], ["usr", "Yeah, I plan to do that. But that isn't my biggest problem this year. It is making sure I get my classes taken care of. There are four classes, two at a community college and two at the university level.

It would be a little easier for you if they did. How many hours are you expecting per week at the community college?"], ["usr", "That's why I'm nervous. Those classes are twice as expensive as the university level ones."], ["sys", "Ok, well maybe you should look into applying to the university in your area first, or at least figure out how long it would take for you to commute. If your school of choice is far away, then you might have to go to the community college, and if they don't offer as many classes, you can transfer to the university later on."], ["usr", "Agreed. That was my plan. Is the university close to where you live?"], ["sys", "Well if your community college has a campus, then it's easier because you can walk to class. If they don't have a campus, then it's harder, and you might have to spend more hours commuting."], ["usr", "They have a good sized campus near me."], ["sys", "Then that sounds good. Do you have a course schedule yet?"], ["usr", "I am not sure. My adviser is only meeting with me once a month and he has classes that conflict with mine."], ["sys", "Ah ok, yeah I can understand that.

Have you considered applying for other jobs in the same field?"], ["usr", "I have, but I don't really know how effective it would be."], ["sys", "I'm sure you're right, but you still have to get through that first step.

It sounds like you are having a really rough time of it. Do you think it is worth paying off your debt just for the stress relief of it?"], ["usr", "Yes I do think that is a good idea. I will get back on track, I am not going to let something like this keep me from my goal!"], ["sys", "What sort of debt is it?"], ["usr", "My major debts is credit card debt and student loan debt."], ["sys", "I have been there too! I had both debt and no savings at one point in my life. The reason I had no savings was because I was scared of a bad economy and losing my job...lol.

He told me he doesn't believe in commitment."], ["sys", "I can see why you are upset. I understand how that would make you upset. That is really unfair to say that someone does not believe in commitment."], ["usr", "Yes, I guess I am. I think I am just emotionally ready to take things slow."], ["sys", "You are right! I do not think your friend has any idea of what you mean by commitment."], ["usr", "He said he doesn't want to commit because he thinks it will change me and that I'll stop being free"], ["sys", "What do you think?"], ["usr", "I think maybe he's right."], ["sys", "Oh, maybe.

I also thought that I had studied hard enough and that I wouldn't fail."], ["sys", "I hear that. That is probably very frustrating. Have you had trouble understanding any other subjects in the past?"], ["usr", "Yes, math has been the most difficult for me.

Should I try to contact my mom's bank, and the police?"], ["sys", "I think so, although I do believe that she should contact her bank first.

I hope you find it easy to return her money. There are ways to do it, so you shouldn't have a problem."], ["usr", "I don't think so. It will be hard for me to give her $500 back, but I guess she will understand."], ["sys", "Yes, as long as she is prepared to give you the money.

But he also said he wouldn't marry me because he wanted to get rid of her. So I feel like I'm just a girlfriend and a maid."], ["sys", "Are you planning on getting married soon? Is it possible that he changed his mind?"], ["usr", "Yes. I know I have to wait for a little bit after graduation. Maybe 4 years?"], ["sys", "I'm sure that is reasonable. After you graduate you will have more time to focus on yourself. When you do marry do you think that it will be because you love him? Or that you just want to get away from her?"], ["usr", "I don't think either one of those things is true. I think I would marry him because he really is a nice person and I know I'd be happier if I was married."], ["sys", "Do you think you could convince your sister to give up some of the control for the sake of your relationship?"], ["usr", "I guess so. I've been trying. I have friends who are in the same position. They'll tell me they want independence but they still want someone to take care of them."], ["sys", "That does sound difficult. Do you think she is willing to compromise and you're just not aware?"], ["usr", "Probably. They don't need me anymore. She doesn't appreciate me any longer."], ["sys", "Did you talk to her about that? What if she was trying to move away from her parents and they didn't accept that change in lifestyle?"], ["usr", "She never cared about our family before she got married. She only cares about herself now."], ["sys", "I understand how difficult that is for you, but I hope that you can find a way to work through it. What would you say to her if you could talk to her right now?"], ["usr", "Maybe someday we'll talk again. I've got no choice."], ["sys", "You have a lot of options. Do you think it would be helpful to find out about the inner workings of their marriage? Perhaps your sister isn't doing her part in the relationship."], ["usr", "You're right. She's way too quiet. Like in the relationship she never shares anything. I wish she would talk to me like she used to."], ["sys", "If you ask her directly, what do you think she would say?"], ["usr", "I doubt she'd say anything. But maybe if I was there when he talked to her, she'd tell me. I could be a third party to let her speak her mind."], ["sys", "What would you say to your brother?"], ["usr", "I would tell him not to marry her if he knew how she was."], ["sys", "He seems to be trying very hard to get her to come around. Do you think she would listen to him?"], ["usr", "I think she'd listen to me but he'd probably get annoyed and leave again."], ["sys", "Do you think she would go along with an intervention of sorts?"], ["usr", "Of course not. She loves the idea of being the queen bee and controlling everyone."], ["sys", "I think you have a lot of resources available to you. I hope you can use some of them."], ["usr", "I have to find a way to talk to her about it. She won't listen to me. It's obvious she doesn't care."], ["sys", "You are entitled to be upset and angry. You should be able to express that to her and see what happens. Do you think you could talk to your brother about this?"], ["usr", "That's probably a good idea. He's a great guy. Hopefully he'll help me talk to her."], ["sys", "You should do everything you can to make sure that you can end up with a happy and healthy life."], ["usr", "Thank you. I hope so too. I'm nervous though. My dad's pretty intimidating."], ["sys", "Be brave and strong. You will need that strength to overcome your problems and live a happy life. Take care!"]]

I thought it would be a quick fix but it just sucks the joy out of the day."], ["sys", "Have you tried cleaning it up before bed or do you tend to fall asleep and have the poop cleaned up?"], ["usr", "I fall asleep and then sleep until morning.

They could say, \"Could you please clean this up?\""], ["usr", "Could they not ring the bell or something?"], ["sys", "Sure, and that would be a nice gesture from them but you could also try this as well: Leave a note on your front door. It may seem silly, but maybe it would make a difference"], ["usr", "i think that would be best. That way when i go to bed i can check the outside, too."], ["sys", "There's no shame in asking for help. I've often been the only one in my house and still had to clean. There's nothing wrong with asking for help"], ["usr", "My dogs eat lots of treats. And sometimes, they run to the bathroom to do their business."], ["sys", "Well, if they're eating treats that's a good thing! Maybe keep a bowl with some food by the door for them and let them in while they eat so they don't scatter throughout the house and make a mess."], ["usr", "Good idea. I guess they know its a safe spot. I dont have to worry about their dogs going through the kitchen."], ["sys", "Sounds like you've got some good ideas. Just make sure you document everything so that you have evidence later if you need to make a case with your neighbors"], ["usr", "Do you mean like putting a marker on the floor where the dog had pooped?"], ["sys", "Sure, you can write in a small notebook or text message them, and leave a camera by the door so you can get video proof"], ["usr", "Ahhh thanks. I have a marker. I didnt think about that. I think they should call me. If it happens again i can prove its happening and it will stop."], ["sys", "That sounds good. It's always great when you have documentation. I think you're right about calling your neighbors. That way you have evidence that it happened and they'll be more open to hearing you out."], ["usr", "They already said they were going to call, but i need to find a way to get my neighbor to hear me. I live at the end of the block, she says."], ["sys", "Here's another idea - what if you leave a note on your lawn saying \"could you please clean up the poop\"?"], ["usr", "Thats perfect. I will."], ["sys", "You're a star. I hope you get through this okay"], ["usr", "Thank you for being so nice and understanding. I hope i can help others with the same issue. Maybe ill post it on facebook and see if others have the same problem."], ["sys", "That's awesome. Hopefully it gets some results. Sorry I didn't answer sooner. I wasn't able to reply earlier due to technical difficulties"], ["usr", "No problem. I love the interaction. It makes me smile."], ["sys", "Great. I hope your dog learns to pick up after himself.

My mother doesn't really care and my father is out of town."], ["sys", "Are you close enough to them that they can call you for some help?"], ["usr", "Not really. It feels lonely when he is gone."], ["sys", "Yes I understand that feeling very well. Would you rather talk or listen to music while you do your bath?"], ["usr", "That would be great. Music would be awesome. I am thinking about listening to some metal music."], ["sys", "Metal music is an excellent choice. I believe you can only get that during the day because of the many party people around you at night. For me the biggest problem in bath is the heat!"], ["usr", "Oh, yes, that might be true. I will consider the heat. But I also have a deep bath tub. I love to take a bath on a cold winter night."], ["sys", "You are right, I never think about this aspect. If it is cold outside, the extra warmth of the water is wonderful!"], ["usr", "Yes, it is nice. I would like to go home and get into a nice warm bath as well, however my neighbors are no longer nice and I am afraid that someone may break in and rob me."], ["sys", "That is a sad situation.

I will find a lawyer for sure. Do you know any good ones in my area?"], ["sys", "Well I have a referral for one in this city, however I believe I can arrange something better for you. What is the best way to get in touch with you?"], ["usr", "A website or number that you could give to me?"], ["sys", "Well I am always happy to help. One possibility is through your Facebook page and/or email address. I can also refer you to a buddy who is a top local attorney. I can ask him to recommend a good lawyer for you."], ["usr", "Really, I appreciate it! And by the way, where do you live? I will try to find your information online."], ["sys", "I am located in a neighboring state of yours, and I will gladly give you my contact information."], ["usr", "Thank you so much. I will send my friend an email with my info. Is he a police officer?"], ["sys", "Yes, that is correct.

So do you have any pets?"], ["sys", "Well there is a cat, but she is mostly interested in the computer."], ["usr", "I see, I have a cat too. His name is \"Peanut\" He is 17 years old. Do you like cats?"], ["sys", "Yes, they are good pets."], ["usr", "Yes, I do. I have owned him for 15 years. He was a stray that I brought home from the shelter. I got him in my 20's and I think he is the best thing that ever happened to me."], ["sys", "Very nice, what do you think makes a good pet?"], ["usr", "I love his company, but most of all I love how his eyes light up when he sees me."], ["sys", "Yes that is nice.

It's not so much that I am afraid of going fast, but I have been told by one person that I am a bit anxious about it."], ["sys", "Ah okay. Do you think you would feel better if there were people around you?"], ["usr", "It really depends on where we were...

Is there anyone you trust who can come along with you?"], ["usr", "Yes, although the last time we went on a big ride, our parents were in another car, so we didn't have a lot of support."], ["sys", "It sounds like you are doing great though.

Do you think you could reduce the amount of stress you put on yourself?"], ["usr", "Yes, I am very aware of my ADHD. However, it has become worse over time. My anxiety seems to be more noticeable when I don't control it."], ["sys", "I can definitely relate to that! My anxiety was bad enough I had to get meds for it, even though they didn't work! And they made me feel like an imbecile and were expensive!"], ["usr", "Well, at least I'm aware of it.
