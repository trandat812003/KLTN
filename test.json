It is really weird how being apart from one another can really change strong relationships. I am still close with everyone but I can not say the same about everyone else. We have all known each other for 25 years and it makes me sad and anxious that when we come out corona it won't\nbe the same. Specifically, two of my besties are arguing with each other over a piece of sensitive gossip that was shared outside our group. Someone feels betrayed and I want to help them both without taking sides.",
